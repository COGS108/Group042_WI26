    "\n",
    "Metrics: The dataset outlines seven variables of various amusement park rollercoasters. The data will be obtained through web scraping rcdb.com (The Roller Coaster Database). Each ride is classified by its name, the park it belongs to, and the chain the park is under. We are going to be recording every ride’s speed, height, length, and number of inversions. Speed refers to the top speed the ride achieves in miles per hour or kilometers per hour throughout its duration. Height refers to the highest measured point of the ride from the floor in terms of feet or meters. Length refers to the total distance the ride travels in feet or meters until it travels from start to finish. Inversions are the number of times the ride turns the riders at a minimum of 135 degrees from beyond the upright position and back at some point during the ride. We will define rides in three categories based on statistics: A thrill coaster is any ride that goes over 55 mph. A family coaster is any time that is between 35 mph and 55 mph. A kiddie coaster is any coaster that goes under 35 mph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was scraped from a well-known website maintained by a team dedicated to compiling information on rides and their various attributes. However, because this site functions as an intermediary, there may be discrepancies in some of the reported measures. Additionally, not all ride details are fully disclosed on the site, requiring supplemental research to address missing information. A further limitation is that thrill level is defined solely based on ride speed, which may oversimplify the concept and not fully capture the overall intensity or experience of a ride.\n",

    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
