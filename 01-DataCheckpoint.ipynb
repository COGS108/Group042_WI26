    "<h3> How do ride thrill characteristics help in predicting roller coaster wait times?</h3>\n",
    "<p> Our Research also consists of 3 sub-questions listed below</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>I. How does a ride’s relative demand within a park (ranked by relative thrill) relate to its average wait time among rides in the same park?</h4>\n",
    "<p><strong>Definition of Relative Thrill:</strong> Relative thrill is a within-park comparative measure that ranks each ride based on its physical intensity characteristics (e.g., maximum speed, height, and ride duration). For each park, rides will be ranked relative to other rides in the same park using these attributes to create a standardized thrill ranking. This approach allows us to evaluate how a ride’s perceived intensity compares to its direct alternatives within the same environment, rather than across different parks with varying ride inventories.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>II. Do longer ride experiences lead to longer wait times independent of thrill level?</h4>\n",
    " \n",
    "<h4>III. Do wait times differ across ride audience categories (Kids, Family, Thrill) defined by ride speed?</h4>\n",

    "The attractions industry is an huge sector in the field of entertainment worldwide, with the top 25 theme parks worldwide seeing 246 million visitors in 2024, a 2.4% growth from the previous year <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). With such a large impact, and millions of visitors around the world, major theme park companies are constantly trying to open world-class rides that attract more visitors to their parks. Within theme parks, some of the most popular rides are roller coasters, with over 6500 operating roller coasters worldwide, and close to 1000 in the United States alone <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Wait times at theme parks, while they can be a hurdle in guest satisfaction, are often used in the amusements industry as a metric for the popularity of rides. New, heavily anticipated attractions, have attracted extremely high wait times, for example Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure had up to 10 hour waits when it opened in 2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), and continues to attract daily waits over 2 hours, 7 years after its opening <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing research has found that different types of attractions, which have different target audiences, lead to different wait time patterns, for example it has been found that children's rides wait times are generally short, and decrease throughout the day, but more major rides reach their peak in the middle of the day <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). Past exploratory research on wait times has found that environmental and external factors, such as weather, season, and holidays affect wait times on the whole <a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6). Moreover, statistical research has been conducted to model wait times throughout a single day<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7), for example Jonathan James found that different rides have different resonsivness to the crowd of a theme park on a given day, with some rides, like Disney's Haunted Mansion, not being very affected by the overall crowd that day. However, this research is very specific to Disney's Magic Kingdom, and is not necessarily generalizable, and much research we surveyed is similar in this sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less major research has been conducted on attributes of the rides themselves and their influence on wait times, looking at roller coasters on a larger scale, across many major theme parks. Some of the key attributes of roller coasters that could influence their popularity are height, maximum speed, and length, to name a few. So, it begs the question, what are the factors that lead to increased or decreased willingness to wait, which we use as a proxy for popularity, as shown by wait times in major theme park attractions. \n",

    "While general intuition might suggest that a more conventionally thrilling ride that is taller/faster would immediately lead to more popularity, we think that it is more complicated than that. Other factors, such as IP (intellectual property), target audience (kiddie, family, thrill), and relative thrill to other rides in the same park, play a larger role in how people choose if they are willing to wait for an attraction."

    "### Data Set 1: Roller Coaster Statistics from Major Theme Parks from Across the World\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics: The dataset outlines seven variables of various amusement park rollercoasters. The data will be obtained through web scraping rcdb.com (The Roller Coaster Database). Each ride is classified by its name, the park it belongs to, and the chain the park is under. We are going to be recording every ride’s speed, height, length, and number of inversions. Speed refers to the top speed the ride achieves in miles per hour or kilometers per hour throughout its duration. Height refers to the highest measured point of the ride from the floor in terms of feet or meters. Length refers to the total distance the ride travels in feet or meters until it travels from start to finish. Inversions are the number of times the ride turns the riders at a minimum of 135 degrees from beyond the upright position and back at some point during the ride. We will define rides in three categories based on statistics: A thrill coaster is any ride that goes over 55 mph. A family coaster is any time that is between 35 mph and 55 mph. A kiddie coaster is any coaster that goes under 35 mph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was scraped from a well-known website maintained by a team dedicated to compiling information on rides and their various attributes. However, because this site functions as an intermediary, there may be discrepancies in some of the reported measures. Additionally, not all ride details are fully disclosed on the site, requiring supplemental research to address missing information. A further limitation is that thrill level is defined solely based on ride speed, which may oversimplify the concept and not fully capture the overall intensity or experience of a ride."

For example, if a ride opened in December 2014, its average wait time is calculated as the average of every operating day's wait time from then until February 2026, when this data was sampled/collected. This makes the data highly resistant to outliers, such as unusually large crowds during holidays or new ride openings.\n",

It aggregates information from theme park apps/web apps that publicly post wait times for attractions. However, there are some limitations such as not all rides have wait time data, not every park publicly posts wait times (although most major park chains do), and posted wait times are never perfectly accurate as they represent the park's best estimate at a given time of day."

    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), for example, through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that is being collected does not track any identifiable information about the individuals inside the park, and therefore would not be collecting any irrelevant information about the people attending the parks. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are collecting does not collect data on any specific group status; it is comprised purely of park attendance statistics and ride attributes. There may potentially be some factors such as the price of attendance, that may affect demographics, but it's not quantifiable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "The data that is being used is collected through public websites made by volunteers, and therefore does not require any particular level of security.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "The data collected is not specific and does not contain any personal information that would need to be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "Due to the data being collected entirely through public websites, there is no way to delete it from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blind spots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "The data collected is simple enough to the point that there are little to no potential blindspots as the data does not engage with any particularly impacted communities. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential dataset bias is that the actual price to attend certain parks may be more expensive and could impact the demographics on who is able to attend and how long they are able to stay at the park. This is why we are planning to compare the rides within their specific thrill category to measure rides against their similar counterparts to limit imbalanced class comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are intentionally measuring major amusement park chains, which may affect demographics, as certain parks may be more expensive, and geographical location may impact who is able to attend and how long they are able to stay at the park. This is because specific regional parks may charge per-ride and would create more inconsistencies in wait times. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The models will accurately reflect the data that is scraped from public websites, and none of it will be tampered with aside from adding in missing information that may be needed pertaining to specific rides. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the data collected tracks any personally identifiable information, and will not be depicted in any of our models. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "All work will be done within the group repository and can easily be shown to the professor/TAs to review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "No unnecessary variables about the actual individuals attending the parks are being collected, making sure that our dataset is not discriminatory in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not measuring particular demographics, therefore eliminating the possibility of errors within different affected groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considering additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are optimizing our model for ride wait times as a means to measure ride popularity, but are also considering several other metrics, such as the ride's characteristics(speed, height, length), as well as park metrics, such as the number of rides within the park itself. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, we are specifically measuring amusement park rides within major chains worldwide, limiting our scope and excluding regional/lesser-known rides and parks. Generally, we are limited to analyzing average park wait times and data on ride attributes. A limitation of our model is that we will not be considering invisible factors, such as the effects of weekdays and weekends, in our data representation. While an important factor, it is vastly too complex and complicated to determine the validity of our hypothesis with such an immense data pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "No specific model will be deployed that requires any down-the-line management/monitoring, and the data analysis will be finalized the day we submit the project. We are not engaging in any sort of high-stakes decisions as the data being used is fairly simple/low-risk. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "No users will be harmed because we are not collecting any personally identifiable information. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code can be changed leading up to the day of our submission.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model, and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have taken several precautions to not use any unethical information and the conclusions that we draw from our model will have no possibility of being abused for any unintended uses."
