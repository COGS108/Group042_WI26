    "The attractions industry is an huge sector in the field of entertainment worldwide, with the top 25 theme parks worldwide seeing 246 million visitors in 2024, a 2.4% growth from the previous year <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). With such a large impact, and millions of visitors around the world, major theme park companies are constantly trying to open world-class rides that attract more visitors to their parks. Within theme parks, some of the most popular rides are roller coasters, with over 6500 operating roller coasters worldwide, and close to 1000 in the United States alone <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait times at theme parks, while they can be a hurdle in guest satisfaction, are often used in the amusements industry as a metric for the popularity of rides. New, heavily anticipated attractions, have attracted extremely high wait times, for example Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure had up to 10 hour waits when it opened in 2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), and continues to attract daily waits over 2 hours, 7 years after its opening <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). \n",
    " Moreover, different types of attractions, which have different target audiences, lead to different wait time patterns, for example it has been found that children's rides wait times are generally short, and decrease throughout the day, but more major rides reach their peak in the middle of the day <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). \n",
    "\n",
    "Past exploratory research on wait times has found that environmental and external factors, such as weather, season, and holidays affect wait times on the whole <a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6). Moreover, statistical research has been conducted to model wait times throughout a single day<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7), though this research is very specific to particular theme parks, and is not necessarily generalizable. However, less major research has been conducted on attributes of the rides themselves and their influence on wait times, looking at roller coasters on a larger scale, across many major theme parks Some of the key attributes of roller coasters that could influence their popularity are height, maximum speed, and theme, to name a few. So, it begs the question, what are the factors that lead to increased or decreased willingness to wait, which we use as a proxy for popularity, as shown by wait times in major theme park attractions. \n",

    "While general intuition might suggest that a more conventionally thrilling ride that is taller/faster would immediately lead to more popularity, we think that it is more complicated than that. Other factors, such as IP (intellectual property), target audience (kiddie, family, thrill), and relative thrill to other rides in the same park, play a larger role in how people choose if they are willing to wait for an attraction."

    "### Roller Coaster Statistics from Major Theme Parks from Across the World\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics: The dataset outlines seven variables of various amusement park rollercoasters. The data will be obtained through web scraping rcdb.com (The Roller Coaster Database). Each ride is classified by its name, the park it belongs to, and the chain the park is under. We are going to be recording every ride’s speed, height, length, and number of inversions. Speed refers to the top speed the ride achieves in miles per hour or kilometers per hour throughout its duration. Height refers to the highest measured point of the ride from the floor in terms of feet or meters. Length refers to the total distance the ride travels in feet or meters until it travels from start to finish. Inversions are the number of times the ride turns the riders at a minimum of 135 degrees from beyond the upright position and back at some point during the ride. We will define rides in three categories based on statistics: A thrill coaster is any ride that goes over 55 mph. A family coaster is any time that is between 35 mph and 55 mph. A kiddie coaster is any coaster that goes under 35 mph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was scraped from a well-known website maintained by a team dedicated to compiling information on rides and their various attributes. However, because this site functions as an intermediary, there may be discrepancies in some of the reported measures. Additionally, not all ride details are fully disclosed on the site, requiring supplemental research to address missing information. A further limitation is that thrill level is defined solely based on ride speed, which may oversimplify the concept and not fully capture the overall intensity or experience of a ride."

For example, if a ride opened in December 2014, its average wait time is calculated as the average of every operating day's wait time from then until February 2026, when this data was sampled/collected. This makes the data highly resistant to outliers, such as unusually large crowds during holidays or new ride openings.\n",

It aggregates information from theme park apps/web apps that publicly post wait times for attractions. However, there are some limitations such as not all rides have wait time data, not every park publicly posts wait times (although most major park chains do), and posted wait times are never perfectly accurate as they represent the park's best estimate at a given time of day."
