    "<h4>I. How does a ride’s relative demand within a park (ranked by relative thrill) relate to its average wait time among rides in the same park?</h4>\n",
    "<p><strong>Definition of Relative Thrill:</strong> Relative thrill is a within-park comparative measure that ranks each ride based on its physical intensity characteristics (e.g., maximum speed, height, and ride duration). For each park, rides will be ranked relative to other rides in the same park using these attributes to create a standardized thrill ranking. This approach allows us to evaluate how a ride’s perceived intensity compares to its direct alternatives within the same environment, rather than across different parks with varying ride inventories.</p>\n",

    "The attractions industry is an huge sector in the field of entertainment worldwide, with the top 25 theme parks worldwide seeing 246 million visitors in 2024, a 2.4% growth from the previous year <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). With such a large impact, and millions of visitors around the world, major theme park companies are constantly trying to open world-class rides that attract more visitors to their parks. Within theme parks, some of the most popular rides are roller coasters, with over 6500 operating roller coasters worldwide, and close to 1000 in the United States alone <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Wait times at theme parks, while they can be a hurdle in guest satisfaction, are often used in the amusements industry as a metric for the popularity of rides. New, heavily anticipated attractions, have attracted extremely high wait times, for example Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure had up to 10 hour waits when it opened in 2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), and continues to attract daily waits over 2 hours, 7 years after its opening <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing research has found that different types of attractions, which have different target audiences, lead to different wait time patterns, for example it has been found that children's rides wait times are generally short, and decrease throughout the day, but more major rides reach their peak in the middle of the day <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). Past exploratory research on wait times has found that environmental and external factors, such as weather, season, and holidays affect wait times on the whole <a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6). Moreover, statistical research has been conducted to model wait times throughout a single day<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7), for example Jonathan James found that different rides have different resonsivness to the crowd of a theme park on a given day, with some rides, like Disney's Haunted Mansion, not being very affected by the overall crowd that day. However, this research is very specific to Disney's Magic Kingdom, and is not necessarily generalizable, and much research we surveyed is similar in this sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less major research has been conducted on attributes of the rides themselves and their influence on wait times, looking at roller coasters on a larger scale, across many major theme parks. Some of the key attributes of roller coasters that could influence their popularity are height, maximum speed, and length, to name a few. So, it begs the question, what are the factors that lead to increased or decreased willingness to wait, which we use as a proxy for popularity, as shown by wait times in major theme park attractions. \n",

    "While general intuition might suggest that a more conventionally thrilling ride that is taller/faster would immediately lead to more popularity, we think that it is more complicated than that. Other factors, such as IP (intellectual property), target audience (kiddie, family, thrill), and relative thrill to other rides in the same park, play a larger role in how people choose if they are willing to wait for an attraction."

    "\n",
    "Metrics: The dataset outlines seven variables of various amusement park rollercoasters. The data will be obtained through web scraping rcdb.com (The Roller Coaster Database). Each ride is classified by its name, the park it belongs to, and the chain the park is under. We are going to be recording every ride’s speed, height, length, and number of inversions. Speed refers to the top speed the ride achieves in miles per hour or kilometers per hour throughout its duration. Height refers to the highest measured point of the ride from the floor in terms of feet or meters. Length refers to the total distance the ride travels in feet or meters until it travels from start to finish. Inversions are the number of times the ride turns the riders at a minimum of 135 degrees from beyond the upright position and back at some point during the ride. We will define rides in three categories based on statistics: A thrill coaster is any ride that goes over 55 mph. A family coaster is any time that is between 35 mph and 55 mph. A kiddie coaster is any coaster that goes under 35 mph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was scraped from a well-known website maintained by a team dedicated to compiling information on rides and their various attributes. However, because this site functions as an intermediary, there may be discrepancies in some of the reported measures. Additionally, not all ride details are fully disclosed on the site, requiring supplemental research to address missing information. A further limitation is that thrill level is defined solely based on ride speed, which may oversimplify the concept and not fully capture the overall intensity or experience of a ride."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An individual may or may not have been informed before entering a theme park that their data will be collected and used, and they were not explicitly told. Theme park data being given out to the public may also be a cause for concern because of users' data privacy being breached. The data being public would create anonymity, being unable to track the data back to separate persons would not allow an option to opt-out which is a cause of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is potential collection bias because only popular theme parks with apps that publish wait times will be included in our wait time data. This excludes more regional/family-owned parks that do not have apps, whose data will not serve much of a purpose for this project, as they do not have thrill attractions. This could potentially lead to misleading information as our results do not cover all global parks. This means that we will narrow our project scope to specifically delineate popular international amusement park chains, and explicitly state that our findings are not generalized to lesser-known parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential dataset bias is that the actual price to attend certain parks may be more expensive, and could impact the demographics on who can attend and how long they are able to stay at the park. This is why we are planning to compare the rides within their specific thrill category to measure rides against their similar counterparts to limit imbalanced class comparison. We are intentionally measuring major amusement park chains, which may affect demographics, as certain parks may be more expensive, and geographical location may impact who is able to attend and how long they are able to stay at the park. This is because specific regional parks may charge per-ride and would create more inconsistencies in wait times. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure honest representation, we will clearly distinguish between raw scraped data and any values input from secondary sources. If specific ride attributes are missing and manually added, these will be documented in our data dictionary. Additionally, our visualizations will maintain the thrill category stratification in our charts to prevent unfair comparisons, such as comparing rides meant for kids with thrill rides.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "The entirety of our workflow will be shown in version control via a GitHub group repository. Pull requests will be used to document and review changes to the notebook. The notebook will depict all the code that we use and what it does. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considering additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are optimizing our model for average wait time as a means to measure ride popularity. We may run into some issues as certain rides with larger capacities may be more popular, but could have lower wait times because the line moves faster as opposed to smaller capacity rides. We will mitigate this by establishing that our models compare relative wait times against other rides in their respective categories.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our models will be based on wait times and how they are affected/unaffected by specific ride attributes. Generally, we are limited to analyzing average park wait times and data on ride attributes. A limitation of our model is that we will not be considering invisible factors, such as the effects of weekdays and weekends, in our data representation because our dataset relies on aggregated averages, and will not contain any time series. \n"
