    "The attractions industry is an huge sector in the field of entertainment worldwide, with the top 25 theme parks worldwide seeing 246 million visitors in 2024, a 2.4% growth from the previous year <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). With such a large impact, and millions of visitors around the world, major theme park companies are constantly trying to open world-class rides that attract more visitors to their parks. Within theme parks, some of the most popular rides are roller coasters, with over 6500 operating roller coasters worldwide, and close to 1000 in the United States alone <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait times at theme parks, while they can be a hurdle in guest satisfaction, are often used in the amusements industry as a metric for the popularity of rides. New, heavily anticipated attractions, have attracted extremely high wait times, for example Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure had up to 10 hour waits when it opened in 2019 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), and continues to attract daily waits over 2 hours, 7 years after its opening <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key attributes of roller coasters that could influence their popularity are height, maximum speed, and theme, to name a few. So, it begs the question, what are the factors that lead to increased or decreased willingness to wait, which we use as a proxy for popularity, as shown by wait times in major theme park attractions. \n",

Other factors, such as IP (intellectual property), target audience (kiddie, family, thrill), and popularity of the park it is in (as measured by annual attendance), play a larger role in how people choose if they are willing to wait for an attraction.\n"

    "For our ideal dataset, we would want data on approximately 600 roller coasters, which provides a large enough sample to compare different ride characteristics while still being manageable. The dataset would include variables such as average wait time (measured consistently over our selected time period), top speed, ride height, ride duration, whether the ride is associated with an intellectual property (IP), target audience (e.g., families, thrill-seekers), construction material (wood or steel), and park location.\n",
    "   The data would ideally be collected from theme parks and public coaster databases, such as park wait-time tracking systems and manufacturer or industry sources. Average wait times could be gathered using historical wait-time data recorded throughout operating hours over multiple days to reduce bias from unusual crowd levels.\n",
    "   Each observation in the dataset would represent one roller coaster, and the data would be stored in a tabular format, such as a CSV file or an Excel Spreadsheet. Rows would correspond to individual coasters, and columns would represent the variables listed above, with standardized units and clearly defined categories to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An individual may or may not have been informed before entering a theme park that their data will be collected and used and were not explicitly told. Theme park data being given out to the public may also be a cause for concern because of users data privacy being breached. The data being public would create anonymity, being unable to track the data back to separate persons would would not allow an option to opt-out which is a cause of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is potential collection bias because only popular theme parks with apps that publish wait times will be included in our wait time data. This excludes more regional/family owned parks that do not have apps, whose data will not serve much of a purpose for this project as they do not have thrill attractions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Limitations that our model will have is that we will not be considering invisible factors such as weekdays and weekends affect on our data representation. While an important factor it is vastly too complex and complicated to determine the validity of our hypothesis with such immense data pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
