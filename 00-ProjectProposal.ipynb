Other factors, such as IP (intellectual property), target audience (kiddie, family, thrill), and popularity of the park it is in (as measured by annual attendance), play a larger role in how people choose if they are willing to wait for an attraction.\n"

    "1. For our ideal dataset, we would want data on approximately 600 roller coasters, which provides a large enough sample to compare different ride characteristics while still being manageable. The dataset would include variables such as average wait time (measured consistently over our selected time period), top speed, ride height, ride duration, whether the ride is associated with an intellectual property (IP), target audience (e.g., family, thrill-seeker), construction material (wood or steel), and park location.\n",
    "   The data would ideally be collected from theme parks and public coaster databases, such as park wait-time tracking systems and manufacturer or industry sources. Average wait times could be gathered using historical wait-time data recorded throughout operating hours over multiple days to reduce bias from unusual crowd levels.\n",
    "   Each observation in the dataset would represent one roller coaster, and the data would be stored in a tabular format, such as a CSV file or an Excel Spreadsheet. Rows would correspond to individual coasters, and columns would represent the variables listed above, with standardized units and clearly defined categories to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.\n",

    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
